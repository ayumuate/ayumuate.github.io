Hi, there! I'm **@ayumuate** or **Dysphoric Ayumuate （不安步根）**, born in 2004, a 19-year-old mundane student majoring in chemistry-related professions in BIPT.

Not proficient in anything —which you can find since there's no repo—, not outgoing or social whatsoever, not looking cute or cool, I'm nothing but nobody in the vast cosmos, awaiting your random discovery. Capable as I am in basic front-end and Python, I'm simply a noob compared with authentic programmers.

I am what I belong to, not what others assigned to me wrongly. Having been *dysphoric* as what I had disguised as in high school long enough, I am sure it's time to come out and live what I actually am. It's not wise to expose my identity directly as I'm unaware of the inclusiveness of people surrounding, but better if I gradually reveal by acting.

## About this site

This site is a blog built on [GitHub Pages] with [Jekyll] and [Chirpy], intending to include:

[GitHub Pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[Jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/
[Chirpy]: https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy

* public jornals adapted from my private journals
* techniques in programming and computer using
* long comments that cannot be contained in the comment area

Blog posts are mainly written in English (US) or Chinese (Simplified), but Japanese may also be included the day I've grasped Japanese. To translate my blog post, I personally recommend ChatGPT and Copilot.

By default, all my blog posts are licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1), which means you are permitted to use my blog posts and

## Meaning of my name

This name is coined from scratch in my mind when signing up for my WeChat account. **Dysphoric** is the adjective form of *dysphoria*, meaning a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction[^dysphoria].

**Ayumuate** consists of two parts:

* **Ayumu** Ayumu Sakura, the heroine of the manga 「おじさんが女子●生に悪いことを教える話」 ([*A Story About an Old Man Teaches Bad Things to a School Girl*](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/ua920785/chapter_1)[^vpn]). Despite an NSFW name, it's actually a very attractive manga. Interestingly, a femboy named Ayumu showed up in 「AYUMU ちょろい男の娘のおはなし」 ([Choroi Otokonoko no Ohanashi](https://mangakakalot.com/manga/yo929441)[^vpn]).
* **-ate** The suffix for esters (e.g. sulfate)[^ate].

Suggested translation:

* Simplified Chinese (简体中文): 不安步根
* Japanese (日本語): 不安な歩酸

If you want it to be translated into other languages, consult ChatGPT with my explanation of my name.
